# Artificial_Intelligence_Task_1

Customer Support Classification using Rule-Based AI:

This project implements two rule-based AI algorithms for classifying customer support tickets. The goal is to compare their performance and assess their suitability for solving the problem of automatic customer support categorization. This README provides setup instructions, usage guidelines, and an overview of the project structure.

Project Structure

The Folder named "Codes" carries the following files:

Keyword Filtering.py: The main Python script that processes the CSV data, applies keyword-based filtering, and categorizes each ticket based on its content.

customer_support_tickets.csv: The input dataset containing customer support tickets. This dataset includes columns like Ticket Description, Customer Name, Customer Age, and more.

Decision_Making.py: The Python script that processes the csv data, applies decision making tree algorithm. 

The folder named "Graphs" shows the graphs generated by each code whereas the folder named CSV Files carries the dataset through which this project has been carried. 
   
Research Goal
To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of Keyword Filtering and Decision Tree approaches in automatically classifying customer support tickets based on categories such as "Billing," "Technical," "Account," etc.
